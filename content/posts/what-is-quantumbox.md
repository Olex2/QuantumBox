QuantumBox is a collaborative community project that will result in the provision of a toolbox for small-molecule crystallography. It will contain all the tools that are necessary to perform meaningful structure analyses now and for the future.

Led by the Universities of [Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/) and [Durham](https://www.durham.ac.uk) , and fully funded by the EPSRC, this three-year project will begin on the first of September 2022.
