QuantumBox is a collaborative community project that will result in the provision of a toolbox for small-molecule crystallography. It will contain all the tools that are necessary to perform meaningful structure analyses now and for the future.

Led by the Universities of [Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/) and [Durham](https://www.durham.ac.uk) this three-year project will run for three years from 1 September 2022.

This project is fully funded by the EPSRC.

There are two aspects to QuantumBox:

## Interoperability of existing (quantum) crystallographic software

## Creation of the Quantum Crystallographic Toolbox (qctbx) within the Computational Crystallography Toolbox (cctbx).
