## QuantumBox for Crystallographers

There are more then 1.2M crystal structures in the CSD -- and most of these have been determined during the last 40 years or so. Despite massive increases in computing power as well as the steady increase in the quality of the data that can be obtain in in laboratories around the world, the way we perform these structural analyses has not really changed.

This is about to change. QuantumBox will make it easy and compelling to try alternative routes, methods and software to obtain the best possible structures for your work. These more accurate crystal structures will also lead to a much better understanding of the material's properties.

## QuantumBox for Developers

There is a very active community of method developers in the area of Crystallography and the field has been steadily advancing since its conception over 100 years ago. Some really powerful methods have been developed, but these have been largely ignored by the community of practising structural analysts.

QuantumBox offers developers an interlinked home for their work. Whether you have been developing a particularly useful snippet of code, a new crystallographic method or are the author of a an entire software system, your software will be made available to all users in a fully-managed environment.
