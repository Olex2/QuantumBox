## Connectivity Analyis

The part of a structure that tell us which atoms are bound to which -- just the overall chemical connectivity. The details -- exact bond distances and angles, residual densities etc. -- do not matter.

## Diffractometer

A sophisticated instrument, with which the diffraction pattern of a crystal can be accurately measured. All structure determinations depend on these measurement results.


## Structure Solution

The step in a structure determination where the electron density maxima in the unit cell are first determined from the raw diffraction data. It doesn't matter *how* this solution was arrived at, once the position of the maxima are known, we can take the structure forward by starting to build our model (i.e. by assigning atom types to these maxima).

## Synchrotron

A synchtroton is a very large machine that produces extremely bright X-rays.

## Unit Cell

A crystal is made from 'infinitely' repeating units. This is called the **unit cell**
